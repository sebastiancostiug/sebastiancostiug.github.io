    <br />
    <p>I'm a geek. I like computers... and computer games</p>
    <br />
    <p>I speak PHP and use the Slim, Yii2 and Laravel dialects.</p>
    <p>
        I also speak JavaScript and am quite familiar with Node.Js,
        React.Js/Next.Js and JQuery.
    </p>
    <p>I also find MySQL a lot of fun.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
        I spend a lot of my time building servers - personal clouds, game
        servers, dav servers, files and media servers, dns, dhcp, mail-relays.
    </p>
    <p>I enjoy setting them up on docker containers.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
        When i get the time and feel like it i play around with, Adobe
        Photoshop, Illustrator and XD (although I prefer the OpenSource
        counterparts - GIMP, InkScape, Figma... ).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        I'm coming from the dental technician field of work, fluent in English
        with a very solid experience in IT & network service.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        I fell inlove with games when i was a kid, to be honest, games were the
        main drive behind my computer passion which led me to understand and
        later work in IT.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>I went to medical school where I got a degree as a dental technician.</p>
    <p>
        Because I couldn't leave computers alone, I returned in IT and web
        development creating a most fortunate combination between my atention
        for detail and patience that I learned and cultivated creating teeth
        with my passion for computers.
